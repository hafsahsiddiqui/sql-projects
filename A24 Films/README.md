# üéûÔ∏è  A24 Films Analysis

I enjoy watching movies. I started watching A24 films more recently such as Civil War, Hereditary, and Dream Scenario and wanted to know more about how A24 is doing. Therefore, I decided to use a dataset that allows me to quickly explore, analyze, and gain insights about the filmography of A24 films such as ratings, directors, box office performance, and more using SQL.

## Background

### Tools
- SQLite3
- Kraggle

### Data Set
When I was starting this project, I found an old public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sebastiansuliborski/a24-studio-movies-dataset) from Kraggle. However, it was a little outdated so I went ahead and manually added all the films and their details from 2023-2025. I also deleted some columns that I wasn't interested in analyzing before using it to write SQL queries. 


[My Updated Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19XDTzVPtD-lCmuN4hJW1MTJ2pu0ymlAF54sYuPQ7vqo/edit?usp=sharing)

### Tableau
I also made a Tableau dashboard after writing the SQL queries to showcase the results using visuals
