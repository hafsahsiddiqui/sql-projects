# üéûÔ∏è  A24 Films Analysis

## Project Overview

I enjoy watching movies. I started watching A24 films more recently after downloading Letterboxd and wanted to know more about how A24 is doing. Therefore, I decided to use a dataset that allows me to quickly explore, analyze, and gain insights about the various aspects of the A24 films to better understand studio's strategies. 

**Goal:** To explore the performance, trends, and key success factors behind A24 films by analyzing their financial returns, critical reception, and production patterns using SQL, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau.

**Tools Used:**
1. SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL) for querying and analysis
2. Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and extended analysis
3. Tableau for visualization

## Background

When I began this project, I discovered a public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sebastiansuliborski/a24-studio-movies-dataset) on A24 films on Kaggle. The dataset was scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A24_films) and then modified and cleaned. While it served as a helpful foundation, it was outdated. To improve the accuracy and depth of my analysis, I manually updated the dataset by adding all A24 film releases from 2023 to 2025, including key details such as release dates, directors, genres, and box office figures. Additionally, I performed data cleaning by removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and dropping irrelevant or inconsistent columns to ensure a cleaner, more analysis-ready dataset.

**Key Data Cleaning and Prep:**
1. Removed duplicates based on the movie_title column to ensure data integrity
2. I manually added 2023-2025 missing films and data, including release date, directors, box office data, and more
3. I included columns such as title, running_time, directed_by, genres, original_or_adaptation, target_age_group, budget, box_office, roi, year, RTC, RTA, audience_critics_gap, metacritic, IMDb, setting, star_attached, director_experience, and more to give a better analysis on what people tend to like more
4. I deleted columns that I didn't need such as ‚ÄúMusic by‚Äù, ‚ÄúScreenplay by‚Äù, ‚ÄúBased on‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdited By‚Äù, ‚ÄúCinematography‚Äù and ‚ÄúWritten by‚Äù
5. Standardized column formats and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., spacing, casing, null values)
6. I made sure all the columns I added are written SQL friendly

## Tableau
I also made a Tableau dashboard after writing the SQL queries to showcase the results using visuals

## Key Takeaways
1. A24's highest ROI films tend to be original, low-budget, and genre-specific (especially horror and psychological thrillers).
2. Directors with prior experience generally produce higher box office returns.
3. Star-attached films show a modest but consistent uplift in performance.
4. The audience-critic gap can be predictive of cult status or streaming longevity.
5. There‚Äôs a clear upward trend in A24‚Äôs critical reception and box office over time (pre-pandemic).
6. Drama dominates ‚Äî Over 80 titles fall into this category, but Horror and Coming-of-Age show the highest ROI swings.
7. A24‚Äôs sweet spot: High creative risk, low financial risk (Moonlight, The Witch, Lady Bird).

## Reflection

What you'd do differently, or next steps (e.g., predictive modeling, sentiment analysis).

What are some problems I faced:
1. **Calculating Profit**: It was hard to calculate the profit because there are multiple things to consider such as production budget, marketing and distribution costs, theaters' share of box office revenue, internaional vs domestic revenue, and more.
