# üéûÔ∏è  A24 Films Analysis

I enjoy watching movies. I started watching A24 films more recently after downloading Letterboxd and wanted to know more about how A24 is doing. Therefore, I decided to use a dataset that allows me to quickly explore, analyze, and gain insights about the filmography of A24 films such as ratings, directors, box office performance, and more using Excel, SQL, and Tableau.

## Background

When I began this project, I discovered a public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sebastiansuliborski/a24-studio-movies-dataset) on A24 films on Kaggle. The dataset was scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A24_films) and then modified and cleaned. While it served as a helpful foundation, it was outdated. To improve the accuracy and depth of my analysis, I manually updated the dataset by adding all A24 film releases from 2023 to 2025, including key details such as release dates, directors, genres, and box office figures. Additionally, I performed data cleaning by removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and dropping irrelevant or inconsistent columns to ensure a cleaner, more analysis-ready dataset.

**Key Data Cleaning and Prep:**
1. Removed duplicates based on the movie_title column to ensure data integrity
2. I manually added 2023-2025 missing films and data, including release date, directors, box office data, and more
3. I included columns such as genres, original_or_adaptation, setting, and more to give a better analysis on what people tend to like more
4. I deleted columns that I didn't need such as ‚ÄúMusic by‚Äù, ‚ÄúScreenplay by‚Äù, ‚ÄúBased on‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdited By‚Äù, ‚ÄúCinematography‚Äù and ‚ÄúWritten by‚Äù
5. Standardized column formats and corrected inconsistencies (e.g., spacing, casing, null values)
6. I made sure all the columns I added are written SQL friendly
